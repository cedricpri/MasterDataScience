    "### Goal of the exercice\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercice has been done by CÃ©dric Prieels. We were asked to implement a few geometrical classes to understand the concept of inheritance in Python. Basically, here is what is asked us to do:\n",
    "\n",
    " * We need to implement four different classes: a superclass called Shape, from which we will derive three children classes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle)\n",
    " * Several functions then need to be written for the different classes, such as a function get_area() which computes the area of the shape, comparison operators (is a shape larger/smaller than another shape based on the area? Are two shapes equal?)\n",
    " * Finally, we also need to be able to sum two geometrical shapes together, and to sum an integer to a shape.\n",
    " * All of this needs to be done while documenting the code, answering a few questions and taking care of raising several NotImplementedErrors if needed. It should also be possible to add a new class without touching the Shape superclass.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Answer to the questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the difference between \\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at the official python documentation [1] to answer this question. According to this, \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ is used to \"compute the official string representation of an object\", and is called by the repr() built-in function. This function should return \"a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value\", or a string describing the object. If the \\_\\_str\\_\\_ method is not present in the class, then this function will be used for the \"informal\" object description as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, \\_\\_str\\_\\_ is used when calling the str(), print() or format() built-in functions and is used to display \"the informal or nicely printable string representation of an object\". The return value must always be a string in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, as a rule of thumb, the function \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ is more used for developers, to display useful informations about the attributes of the class themselves, while the \\_\\_str\\_\\_ function is usually used to display the main data of the object created to the user in an informal way, hiding the technical informations they do not really need to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can we implement all the functions in the Shape superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not make much sense to try to define all the functions in the shape superclass, since most of them require a different treatment based on the geometrical shape considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the get_area() function is quite different depending on the shape, since the way to calculate the area of a triangle is quite different than the way to calculate the area of a rectangle, for example. Since all the shapes are quite different and do not have the number of sides for example, it sense makes to define the different methods directly within the subclasses, even though we might consider the option to define the number of sides as a list and as an attribute of the superclass itself, which would completely change the structure of the following code. The NotImplementedError raised by the superclass should help avoid any issue when defining a new shape without a get_area() function, for example, as it will let the user know this function has not been defined."
